### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Thamil.

I'm a PhD candidate working on the supercritical water flow and heat transfer studies under Prof. Sandip K Saha and Prof. Amit Agrawal at IIT Bombay.

My works involves modelling non-linearity in supercritical heat transfer arising due to variation in properties in buoyant-driven channel flows.
